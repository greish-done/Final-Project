# Final-Project
This project is a final project of 'Introduction to Visual Media Programmimg' class in Sogang university. A goal of the project is making a game with python programmimg.

## "Under the Sea"

The name of the game I made is "Under the Sea". When you run the game, you can see the initial screen first. On the initial screen, you are able to see an illustration of under the sea and you are able to hear the song, "Under The Sea". If you press any button, the screen will change and the game starts. A killer whale is the player, and your goal is avoiding bigger marine lives and hunting smaller marine lives. Three lives are given at the beginning and if you collide with a bigger marine life, you will lose one life. if you collide with a smaller one, your size will be bigger. Each marine life has there own feature so figure it out and try your best to survive!

### Features

* There are fish of various sizes roamimg around.

* Since the size of each fish is random, the bigger you are, the more advantages you take!

* Therefore, once you play game well in the beginning, the game becomes easier after a certain point.
